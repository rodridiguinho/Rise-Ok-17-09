The previous AI engineer undertook an iterative development process for a cash control system, starting with a pixel-perfect frontend clone with mock data. Key features like dashboard, transactions, reports, and settings were established. Initial backend integration was challenged by Pydantic v2 errors, leading to model simplifications. Critical functionality, such as user creation, client, and supplier management with unique identifiers, along with Rise Travel branding and mobile responsiveness, were added based on user feedback. The engineer faced persistent data saving issues for user-created entities, despite automated tests indicating success. This culminated in user frustration over deployment costs for a buggy system. The final trajectory indicates a crucial pivot: the AI engineer acknowledged the issues, confirmed a failed deployment, and committed to following user-provided support advice to debug the local preview environment methodically, with console logs, before redeploying.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a pixel-perfect clone of a cash control system from a provided link (), including its design, layout, colors, fonts, images, and animations. The application should not integrate with banks but must support PDF and Excel export (initially mocked). Key functionalities explicitly requested and implemented include:
- A login page (email: , password: ).
- A comprehensive dashboard with financial summaries and recent transactions.
- Transaction management (CRUD operations, filters).
- User management (create, edit, delete users with roles like Admin, Seller, Operator).
- Client management, including a unique client number/code for each.
- Supplier management, including a unique supplier number/code and categories.
- Reporting features for financial analysis with PDF/Excel export (mocked).
- System settings.
- Branding customized to Rise Travel with specific pink/orange gradient colors.
- Full mobile responsiveness across devices.
The core problem is providing an internal cash control system for a travel agency, mimicking an existing professional application, with specific data management and reporting capabilities.

<pending_tasks>
- Investigate and fix the data persistence issues reported by the user for creating/editing/deleting clients and users in the *preview* environment, which contradicts previous automated testing results.
- Implement the actual PDF and Excel export functionalities, as they are currently mocked.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the process of debugging persistent data saving issues for user-created entities, specifically for new users and potentially clients/suppliers. The user reported that changes (creating new users, deleting existing ones) were not being saved and reverted upon navigation.
Initially, the AI engineer believed the backend was functioning correctly based on direct API tests and an automated frontend test, attributing the user's perception of bugs to browser cache or incorrect URLs. However, the user expressed frustration over being charged for a deployed, non-functional system.
Upon the user's recent input, which included detailed advice from support, the AI engineer recognized the severity of the situation. The AI confirmed that the deployed URL () was not resolving (), indicating a deployment failure, meaning the user was paying for a service that was not even online.
The current immediate work involves following the support's guidance:
1.  Focusing on debugging the *local preview environment* first.
2.  Keeping the browser's **console window open** to capture exact error messages when attempting to replicate the reported data persistence issues (creating/editing/deleting clients/users/suppliers).
3.  Using these captured errors for precise bug fixing.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Test the local preview environment, with the console open, specifically attempting to create and save a new user to capture any console errors.
