The AI engineer's work primarily focused on refining and expanding the Rise Travel cash control system, iteratively addressing user feedback and fixing regressions. Initial efforts targeted sales analytics, resolving a 404 error by correctly registering the  endpoint. A major challenge was consistent data display across different report types, leading to multiple adjustments in backend logic (e.g., , ) to ensure correct aggregation of supplier costs and commissions, and frontend rendering (e.g., , ).

A significant architectural change was introducing new transaction types (, ) to logically separate sales-related transactions from general operational expenses, requiring updates across backend models and frontend forms. Critical bugs included the disappearance of passenger reservations due to incorrect filtering and negative values for entry transactions, which were meticulously traced and fixed. The engineer also simplified the transaction creation form and implemented a data migration feature. The most recent task involves building a new Controle Interno module, starting with frontend component creation and sidebar integration. Persistent issues often involved frontend cache or misaligned frontend/backend data expectations, necessitating careful debugging and reiteration.

The Rise Travel application, a cash control system for a travel agency, manages users, clients, and suppliers with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Core functionalities include transaction CRUD with travel-specific fields, auto-profit calculation, and a timezone-aware flight schedule system. UI/UX is mobile-responsive with Shadcn UI.

Phase 2, Controle de Passageiros, was expanded to include detailed flight info, scales, editable passenger data, and fields for supplier, emission type, and reservation number. The Gerenciar modal required a line-by-line layout with flight timings, stopovers, and a passenger deletion option. Additional requirements included persistent login, sales-only analytics (excluding general expenses, correctly aggregating sales-related costs), and functional user creation. Recent focus shifted to refining analytics accuracy, specifically:
-   Correct financial and sales analytics periodization (month start to current day).
-   Accurate inclusion of supplier costs and sales quantities in reports.
-   Consistent commission calculation across analytics and ranking.
-   Simplifying the new transaction form by removing flight details, while preserving them in Passenger Control.
-   Adding a bank account selection field for all transaction types.
-   Ensuring automatic reservation generation in Passenger Control.
-   Adding a manual reservation creation button.
-   Implementing a new Controle Interno module with five distinct sections for internal financial and operational tracking.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a new Controle Interno module. This module is entirely for internal tracking, separate from sales analytics and cash flow, and will contain five distinct sections:
1.  **Investimento de Sócios** (Partner Investment)
2.  **Pagamentos de Clientes Parcelados** (Installment Client Payments)
3.  **Controle de Cliente com Controle de Milhas** (Client Miles Control)
4.  **Contas com Sócios** (Partner Accounts)
5.  **Links de Consolidadoras, Operadores, Serviços e Usuários** (Consolidator, Operator, Service, and User Links)

Each section requires specific fields as detailed by the user, and a Add 1 more button for multiple entries. The engineer confirmed the request and the inclusion of two additional fields: Número de registro gerado na venda for client payments and Data de retirada for partner accounts. The work commenced by creating the new frontend component . The next step is to integrate this component into the application's sidebar, making it accessible via a new Controle Interno button. This work is ongoing, with only the component file created so far.
