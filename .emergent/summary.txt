The AI engineer's trajectory involved significant work on the Controle de Passageiros system, including UI enhancements, data persistence, and bug fixes. A recurring and challenging issue was persistent frontend caching, which often prevented UI updates from rendering despite backend and frontend code changes, necessitating repeated cache clearing and component re-evaluation. The engineer successfully added comprehensive flight and passenger details, addressed airport autocomplete, and resolved timezone calculation errors.

Several regressions occurred, causing frustration and requiring careful rollbacks to previous stable versions, particularly concerning supplier and passenger data display and saving. The engineer also fixed user creation, implemented a dedicated sales analytics module, and improved login persistence. The most recent task focused on refining the passenger management UI with a detailed line-by-line layout and adding a delete passenger function. The immediate problem is that the  endpoint for the sales analytics is not being registered in the backend, leading to a 404 error.

The Rise Travel application is a cash control system for a travel agency, cloning . It utilizes a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB to manage users, clients, and suppliers. Key features include full CRUD for transactions with travel-specific fields, auto-profit calculation, and a timezone-aware flight schedule system with layover support. The UI/UX is mobile-responsive using Shadcn UI.

Phase 2, Controle de Passageiros, displays reservation cards, showing client, route, dates, and passenger counts. User requests expanded this to include detailed flight information, scales, editable passenger data (nationality, passport), and new fields for supplier selection (initially from a list, later changed to manual input), free-text emission type, and supplier phone. Further enhancements for the Gerenciar modal included manual input fields for product type, client reservation code, specific flight timings (departure/arrival/duration for outbound/return, plus stopover details), a highly structured line-by-line layout, and a passenger deletion option. Additional requirements include persistent login, a sales-only analytics module (excluding general expenses) that correctly aggregates commission and supplier costs from output transactions, and functional user creation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two recent user feedback points:
1.  **Adding a delete button for passengers**: The user requested functionality to remove passengers from an existing reservation. The AI engineer located the passenger listing logic in  and implemented a UI button with a  icon alongside each passenger entry. A corresponding  function was developed and integrated to handle the removal of a passenger from the reservation, likely by updating the transaction in the backend.
2.  **Sales Analytics showing zero values**: The user reported that the Sales Analytics section displayed 0,00 for supplier costs and commissions. Upon investigation, the AI engineer performed a backend test using  against the  endpoint. This test revealed a **404 Not Found** error for the endpoint. The root cause was identified as the  (which defines the  endpoint in ) not being explicitly imported and registered within the main FastAPI application in .
