The AI engineer's trajectory focused on building the Controle de Passageiros system, starting from basic UI to complex data persistence and display. A significant challenge was a persistent frontend caching issue, necessitating repeated attempts at cache clearing and alternative implementation strategies. Initial work involved implementing the Gerenciar modal for passenger management and adding flight details and supplier information. A critical bug in passenger persistence led to backend modifications in  and  to support  as a field, and corresponding frontend logic updates. Additional fields like passport details, airline, and notes were added. The engineer also addressed user-reported bugs regarding airport autocomplete (Campinas) and timezone calculations in , with the timezone issue being resolved. A major regression where passenger data disappeared from the modal was successfully fixed. The work concluded with the AI planning to integrate supplier fields directly into the functioning passenger section to bypass the persistent UI cache, as the supplier information was still not rendering despite backend and frontend code being in place.

The Rise Travel application is a cash control system for a travel agency, aiming to clone . It manages users, clients, and suppliers with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Key features include comprehensive transaction management with travel-specific fields, auto-profit calculation, and full CRUD. Miles-related fields now include calculated Valor Total das Milhas and editable Programa de Milhas. An advanced flight schedule system with Ida and Volta sections, auto-calculated duration (timezone-aware), and conditional layover fields is implemented. Saída transactions can reference Entrada internal codes. An auto-generated  is visible. The UI/UX is mobile-responsive using Shadcn UI. Airport autocomplete for city inputs allows specific airport selection. Phase 2, the Controle de Passageiros system, displays reservation cards from entry transactions, showing client, route, dates, and initial passenger count, with a base for a reminder system. User requests evolved to include displaying flight details, scales, supplier name, nationality, passport details, editable airline, and additional notes within the Gerenciar modal.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React**: Frontend framework.
-   **FastAPI**: Python backend, Pydantic for data validation.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database, UUIDs for IDs.
-   **Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS**: Styling and component library.
-   **Axios**: HTTP client.
-   **Dynamic Frontend Components**: Conditional rendering.
-   **Local Data Management**: JavaScript-based timezone and airport data.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture: React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for persistence.


-   :
    -   **Summary**: The main FastAPI application, handling API routes and data processing.
    -   **Changes**:  model was extended to include  (list of Passenger objects), , , , and . The  and  endpoints were updated to correctly accept and persist these new fields to the MongoDB database.
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Defines the Pydantic data schema for transactions.
    -   **Changes**: Expanded to include a  Pydantic model (defining fields like , , , , ) and the  field within the main  schema for persistence.
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Central component for transaction CRUD. Handles advanced flight details and city inputs.
    -   **Changes**: The  array was updated to include more Brazilian cities (e.g., Campinas/Viracopos) to improve autocomplete functionality. The  object was also updated for Campinas to ensure accurate flight duration calculations. This file also contains the  logic.
-   :
    -   **Summary**: A newly created component for passenger reservation management, displaying reservation cards and a Gerenciar modal.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented states for modal visibility and form data. Includes  to fetch transactions and  to fetch supplier data from the backend. The  function was updated to populate the modal with reservation details. The modal's UI was enhanced to display comprehensive flight details, scales, editable passenger information (including nationality, passport), and new fields for supplier selection, free-text emission type, and supplier phone. Crucially,  and  functions were modified to make API calls () to persist passenger and supplier data to the backend.
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Centralized Axios instance for HTTP requests to the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Ensures the  function correctly formats and sends updated transaction data (including passengers and new supplier details) to the backend. It also supports fetching supplier data via .
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Environment variables for the frontend application.
    -   **Changes**: The  variable was added to address WebSocket connection issues, and  was corrected to  to match the correct preview URL.

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate and display supplier fields (selection from actual suppliers, free-text emission type, supplier phone) correctly in the Gerenciar modal within , potentially using a more robust method to bypass cache.
-   Address persistent autocomplete issues for specific cities (e.g., Campinas) in .
-   Implement remaining Passenger Control features: full reminder system, explicit Add Passenger button functionality for new passengers, save extra services.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two critical user feedback points related to the Controle de Passageiros system. First, a major regression occurred where previously working passenger data stopped appearing in the Gerenciar modal of . This bug was successfully identified and fixed by the AI, and the passenger data (e.g., rodrigo • Adulto) now correctly displays within the modal.

Second, the user clarified the requirements for supplier-related fields: the supplier should be selectable from a list of *existing* suppliers in the system, tipo de emissão (emission type) should be a free-text input, and a supplier contact phone number field is needed. The AI engineer updated  to fetch  from the backend via , implemented a  component for supplier choice, an  for free-text , and another  for . The backend  was also modified to include  and  fields in the  model and the  and  API endpoints, ensuring data persistence.

Despite these code-level changes, the persistent frontend cache issue continues to prevent the newly implemented supplier-related fields from appearing in the UI. The engineer's last action indicated a plan to integrate these supplier fields directly into a section of the modal that is already rendering correctly, aiming to overcome the caching problem.
