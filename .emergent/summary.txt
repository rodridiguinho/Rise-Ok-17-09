<analysis>
The trajectory outlines the iterative development of the Rise Travel application. Initially, an AI engineer implemented the Controle Interno and enhanced Controle de Passageiros but faced critical bugs leading to perceived data loss and user dissatisfaction, including an HTTP 422 error and issues with analytics, prompting user requests for rollbacks. The current AI engineer (me) systematically resolved several complex issues: fixing the HTTP 422 error, implementing dynamic IDA/VOLTA cards, correcting city data loading for flight calculations, ensuring passenger details visibility post-save, and adding profit display to transaction cards. The most recent and successful task involved integrating a new Pagamentos Mensais Fixos section within Controle Interno, including CRUD and duplication functionalities. The user confirmed the current system state is functional and requested a checkpoint and deployment.

<product_requirements>
The Rise Travel app, a cash control system for a travel agency, evolved from basic transaction management to advanced features. Key user requirements included:
1.  **Controle Interno Module**: A new, independent module comprising five distinct sections (Partner Investment, Installment Client Payments, Client Miles Control, Partner Accounts, Consolidator/Operator/Service/User Links), each with form submissions, Add 1 more functionality, and admin access.
2.  **Passenger Control Enhancements**: Display of  for round trips, an internal notification system for upcoming trips, and a secure hide reservation feature using confirmation code 135200 without deleting sales transactions. Also, the implementation of separate IDA and VOLTA cards with full passenger details, flight times, and scale information, and ensuring correct data saving and visibility post-edit.
3.  **Analytics Refinement**: Strict data source separation for Sales Analytics (only /) and Financial Analytics (all transaction types).
4.  **Transaction Display**: Consistent display of supplier values and commission (with percentage) on all transaction cards, adaptable to different data structures. Later, a Lucro (profit) display (Sales Value - Supplier Value - Commission) was requested and implemented.
5.  **New Internal Control Section**: A Pagamentos Mensais Fixos (Fixed Monthly Payments) section with fields for account type, company, value, interest, payment date, payment account, paid status, along with add, duplicate, and delete functionalities.
Initial bug fixes included automatic  generation and analytics report conflicts. Future considerations include CRM Kanban, WhatsApp integration, and traffic attribution.

-   **State Management**: Added new React states for  data.
-   **Functionality**: Created  to save new payment entries,  to clone an existing payment for the subsequent month (resetting its paid status), and  for removing entries.
-   **UI Integration**: The new section was integrated into , including a new navigation tab and a dedicated rendering area.
-   **Form & Display**: A comprehensive form was created with fields for 'Tipo de Conta', 'Nome da Empresa', 'Valor', 'Valor de Juros', 'Data de Pagamento', 'Conta Usada para Pagamento', and a 'Marcar como pago' checkbox. The system displays saved payments in cards, showing all these details, a 'Pago'/'Não Pago' status, and a button to duplicate for the next month. The user confirmed this functionality is working as expected.
