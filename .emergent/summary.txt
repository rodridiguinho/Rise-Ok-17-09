The AI engineer's work on Rise Travel involved a series of iterative feature enhancements and bug fixes, primarily within the frontend  and  components, with corresponding backend updates in  and . Initial efforts resolved a critical login issue by correcting frontend  to correctly parse backend  (Chat 44). Subsequent work focused on expanding transaction functionality, including adding detailed miles-related fields and supporting free-text input for miles programs (Chat 65, 111).

A major development involved implementing a sophisticated flight schedule system, introducing distinct Ida and Volta sections, conditional layover fields, and a timezone-aware duration calculation (Chat 160, 186). This required significant refactoring and backend model updates for persistence (Chat 316, 318). A bug where internal reservation codes weren't visible or persisted was fixed by updating both frontend display logic (Chat 271) and backend saving (Chat 293, 297).

The project then moved to enhancing user experience with an autocomplete system for airport cities, which evolved from fixing focus issues (Chat 347) to handling multiple airports per city (Chat 364) and ensuring autocomplete worked for scale cities (Chat 391, 397). Finally, Phase 2, the Controle de Passageiros system, was initiated. This involved creating a new sidebar navigation, a dedicated component () to display and manage reservations, and integrating it with existing transaction data (Chat 409, 413, 429). Debugging was required to fix import and API call issues within this new component (Chat 447, 449). The current state is that the Controle de Passageiros dashboard loads, but clicking Gerenciar buttons does not show any modal content, and a new request to display the main passenger's name on the cards has been made. The  was effectively used to diagnose complex issues related to component rendering and backend data persistence.

<product_requirements>
The Rise Travel application is a comprehensive cash control system for a travel agency, aiming for a pixel-perfect clone of , with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. It manages users, clients, and suppliers.

**Key features developed**:
*   **Transaction Management**: Extensive travel-specific fields, auto-profit calculation, full CRUD.
    *   **Miles**: Fields for calculated Valor Total das Milhas and Taxas de Emissão (non-calculative for totals). Programa de Milhas now an editable input with autocomplete.
    *   **Advanced Flight Schedule**: Structured Ida and Volta sections with departure/arrival times, auto-calculated duration, conditional layover fields (city, times, auto scale duration).
    *   **Timezone-Aware Calculations**: Automatic flight duration for international flights using a local timezone database.
    *   **Smart Expense Transaction**: Saída transactions can reference Entrada internal codes to auto-load client, destinations, dates, etc., plus a free text observation field.
    *   **Internal Reservation Code**: Auto-generated (RT-2025-XXXX) and visible for each transaction.
*   **UI/UX**: Mobile-responsive, Shadcn UI, R$ currency.
*   **Airport Autocomplete**: City inputs (departure, arrival, scale) now offer autocomplete for global airports, allowing selection of specific airports (e.g., GRU vs. CGH).
*   **Passenger Control System (Phase 2)**: A new sidebar tab Controle de Passageiros displays reservation cards auto-loaded from entry transactions, showing client, route, dates, and initial passenger count. A base for a reminder system is included.

The system streamlines financial tracking, detailed travel logging, and customer relationship management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented and tested a significant portion of Phase 2: Passenger Control System. The Controle de Passageiros tab was added to the sidebar, and a new component () was created and integrated into the main dashboard. This component now automatically fetches existing Entrada (income) transactions, processes them into reservas (reservations), and displays them as interactive cards. Each card visually summarizes key reservation details like internal code, client, route, and dates, and includes a visual lembretes (reminders) status (e.g., 3 dias, Amanhã).

The AI engineer addressed several compilation and API integration issues within  (e.g., correcting the  import to  and fixing the  call) to bring the dashboard to a functional state. The user, however, reported a critical bug: Ficou bom, porem quando clico em gerenciar alem das outras funçoes que ainda vão ser gerada não aparce mais nada (Chat 453), indicating that while the reservation cards are visible, clicking the Gerenciar button on these cards does not open the expected passenger management modal. The AI engineer has initiated investigation into this specific Gerenciar button functionality, checking the component's modal implementation and button imports (Chat 455-458). Concurrently, the user has also requested an enhancement: Tambem é interessante que o nome do passageiro principal já aparece na tela de cards da dash bord do controle de passageiros (Chat 459), to display the main passenger's name directly on the reservation cards. The AI engineer has acknowledged this new request (Chat 460). Thus, the immediate focus is on fixing the non-functional Gerenciar button and then implementing the display of the main passenger's name on the reservation cards.
