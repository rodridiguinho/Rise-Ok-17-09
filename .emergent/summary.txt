The AI engineer undertook an iterative development process for a cash control system. Initially, the focus was on addressing persistent data saving bugs for users, clients, and transactions, which were repeatedly reported by the user despite initial automated tests passing. Root causes were identified as local state updates without API calls (user deletion), mock data usage without real API integration (clients, transactions), and a database wipe (login failure due to missing user). After resolving these core persistence issues and fixing a frontend login API configuration, the engineer moved into a feature expansion phase. Key additions included real PDF/Excel exports, detailed sales and financial analytics dashboards (mimicking AgentePro), comprehensive transaction fields for a travel agency (seller, commission, supplier payment, dates, calculated profit), a supplier type field, Rise Travel branding, and an Administration settings tab. The engineer consistently addressed user frustration over billing for unresolved issues by rigorously debugging and testing until the features worked, often relying on the troubleshoot agent for root cause analysis. The current work involves implementing advanced travel-specific transaction and supplier fields.

<product_requirements>
The application is a pixel-perfect clone of a cash control system for a travel agency, mimicking . It supports a login page (email: , password: ), a dashboard with financial summaries and transactions, and CRUD operations for users (Admin, Seller, Operator roles), clients (unique code), and suppliers (unique code, categories, now also purchase type). Key features include transaction management (CRUD, filters, now with extensive travel-specific fields like locator, dates, commission, supplier payment, profit calculation, multi-product), reporting with PDF/Excel export (now real, not mocked), and system settings. The branding is Rise Travel with specific colors and logo. The system must be fully mobile-responsive. Recent additions include detailed sales and financial analytics dashboards, seller ranking, custom expense categories, period-based reporting, and support for R$ currency and historical data entry. The core problem is providing a robust internal cash control system for a travel agency with specific financial tracking and reporting needs.

<pending_tasks>
- Integrate the newly added travel-specific fields for suppliers (, , etc.) into the frontend  component.
- Fully implement the complex  component with all the requested fields for multiple products, dates, times, origins/destinations, and trip types.
- Integrate a suggested API for automatically searching available airlines.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing highly detailed travel agency-specific fields for transactions and suppliers. Specifically, after creating  to handle complex transaction inputs, the immediate task is to update the  component. This update involves incorporating new fields such as tipo de compra (type of purchase: Milhas, Dinheiro, Voucher) and related details like , , , , and . This work requires modifications in  to render these new input fields and connect them to the backend API, which has already been updated in  and  to support these new data points.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Update the  component to include the remaining travel-specific purchase fields.
