# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

Backend API works perfectly (confirmed by testing agent), issue was frontend not properly extracting transaction data from {message, ...transaction} response format. Applied fix to destructure response correctly and update local state immediately. Needs frontend testing to confirm the real-time update works."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Investigate why supplier costs are showing R$ 0,00 in analytics by checking actual transaction data in the database. SPECIFIC INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS: 1. **Authentication**: Use rodrigo@risetravel.com.br / Emily2030* 2. **Check Database**: Get current transactions and examine supplier cost fields 3. **Test Current Month**: Check transactions for September 2025 (current month) 4. **Analyze Fields**: Look for supplierValue, supplierCosts, supplier fields in existing transactions 5. **Test Sales Analysis**: Call /api/reports/sales-analysis with current month dates to see what's being calculated CONTEXT: Frontend analytics shows 'CUSTOS FORNECEDORES: R$ 0,00' but should show supplier costs. Need to investigate if: - Existing transactions have supplierValue fields populated - The calculation logic is working correctly - The date filtering is correct INVESTIGATION FOCUS: Find out why total_supplier_costs is 0 when there are transactions with suppliers."

When transactions have supplier costs, the analytics correctly calculates and displays them. ✅ SOLUTION: Users need to edit existing transactions to add supplier cost information (supplierValue field) for accurate analytics reporting."

Only the main api_router is included via app.include_router(api_router). ✅ FIELD MAPPING VERIFIED: Tested with alternative /api/reports/sales-analysis endpoint - when transactions have supplierValue fields populated, analytics correctly calculate supplier costs (R$ 1800.00 from test data). ✅ CALCULATION LOGIC WORKING: The analytics logic is sound - issue is purely that the endpoint is not accessible due to missing route imports. ✅ SOLUTION: Import reports_routes.py into server.py using app.include_router(reports_router) to make sales-performance endpoint accessible."

Tested WITHOUT miles (R$ 950.00 = R$ 800.00 + R$ 150.00) and WITH miles (supplier R$ 1200.00, miles R$ 2400.00) - all calculations correct and persistent.

      message: "🚨 SALES PERFORMANCE ENDPOINT INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Successfully debugged why /api/reports/sales-performance returns zeros for analytics. ROOT CAUSE: The endpoint returns 404 Not Found because separate route files in /app/backend/routes/ are NOT being imported into main server.py. The endpoint exists with complete implementation in reports_routes.py but is inaccessible. SOLUTION: Import the reports router using app.include_router(reports_router) in server.py. FIELD MAPPING CONFIRMED: Analytics logic is working correctly - when transactions have supplierValue fields, calculations work properly (verified with test data showing R$ 1800.00 supplier costs). The issue is purely routing, not calculation logic."

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Add 'passengers: Optional[list] = []' field to TransactionCreate model in backend/server.py and update transaction creation/update logic to handle passenger data persistence."

If supplier is not appearing in passenger control modal, this is a FRONTEND issue - either the modal component is not reading the supplier field from transaction data, or there's a frontend filtering/processing problem. ✅ RECOMMENDATION: Check frontend passenger control modal component to ensure it's properly accessing and displaying the 'supplier' field from transaction data.
